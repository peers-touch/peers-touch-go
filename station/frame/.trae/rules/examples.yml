# Examples Directory Rule
# This rule informs the AI assistant about the location and structure of examples

examples:
  location: "peers-touch-go/example"
  description: "Contains example implementations and usage demonstrations for the peers-touch-go framework"
  
  structure:
    bootstrap: "Bootstrap node example with configuration files"
    config: "Configuration source examples"
    hellohumans: "Human interaction example with peer configuration"
    helloworld: "Basic hello world example with actor and peer setup"

  usage_guidelines:
    - "When asked for examples, always check the peers-touch-go/example directory first"
    - "Use existing examples as templates for new implementations"
    - "Refer to configuration files in conf/ subdirectories for setup patterns"
    - "Examples demonstrate both basic and advanced usage patterns"
  
  note: "This directory contains working examples that demonstrate various aspects of the framework including bootstrap nodes, peer communication, DHT operations, and configuration management"
